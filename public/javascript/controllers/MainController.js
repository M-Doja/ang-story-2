    text1: "Image if one day you found out everything that you thought that you knew was actually a lie, like it never really existed in the first place. How would you know who to trust, or even what to believe? Welcome to the new life of Nathaniel Covacs. Nate as he often called, is an IT tech by day but by night he transforms into one of the world's brightest hacker for hire. Taking a new job on a whim, while performing a hack, he uncovers information that he shouldn't have and was ment to be buried. Aware of the seriousness of his recent find he comes to the realization that he may be in danger, but too little to late. Nate is attacked and abducted and made to have seemingly died in an accidental expolosion that tore his and other apartments to pieces. Disoriented, unaware and confused, Nate is made to believe that the world is under global attack, and that his abductors are actually his rescuers in an attempt to exploit Nate's natural talent for hacking. In truth Nate's captors frequently placed him in induced comas where tests where ran in order to gain full body and mental control. While in these induced comas he often began passing in and out of conscienceness blurring and changing the focus of what was real and what was dream."
